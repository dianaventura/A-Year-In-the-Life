## 📌 Project Overview
This is not just any data project - it's a personal journey through a year's worth of data. I've dived into my HealthKit stats, Spotify jams, work schedules, and mood diaries to uncover where my time went and what accomplishments I’ve made along the way.
This exploration goes beyond data to ask the question what is my definition of success and what achievements am I most proud of?. 📊🎶📆

## 📊 Data Sources
- **HealthKit:** Step count data from my HealthKit apple records. 👣
- **Spotify:** A year's worth of my music listening history 🎧
- **Work Schedules:** Balancing life and work - a look into my work schedules and university timetables. 💼
- **Mood Data:** Adjectives used, number of pages written and a mood score from each entry of my journal. 🎢

## 💡 Key Findings
- **Activity Peaks:** My most active day was on Thursdays. I hit 8,684 steps! 🌟
- **Music and Mood:** I'm at my happiest when I'm learning!!! The Lex Fridman Podcast was my most listened to artsit when I was happy. 🎸
- **Work and Well-being:** I clocked in impressive hours and got a 55 day work day streak! I increasingly used the word "creative" when I was at my summer intership. 📈
- **Mood Patterns:** Writing, Learning, Staying Busy - these things affect me positively! My Mood boosts 40% from Sunday to Monday 🗯️

## 🎓 Results!

🎧 **Consistent Growth and Learning:** Turns out that for me success is about staying intellectually stimulated and constantly learning. 🤓

💼 **Work Brings Joy:** My summer long work streak had me feeling creative during my summer internship, revealling that I find true joy in my work. 💖

✍️ **Writing as an Outlet:** Intense emotions - I love them. Writing is my sanctuary, I write more when I feel more 🌟

🌈 **Overall:** This journey has been about understanding what makes me tick, what keeps me moving forward, and what makes a day feel successfull. Success isn't one thing, all my daily habits contribute to my overall output. 🚀
The achievemnet I'm most proud of from this year is that I accumulated alot of working hours AND I enjoyed it. Success to me is accumulating experiences that fuel me.


## 🔮 Future Directions
This is just a starting point I plan on making this project a yearly tradition so I can compare stats annually 🌐
